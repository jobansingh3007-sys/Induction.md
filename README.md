### Day 1
My first day at GNDEC started with all CSE and IT students.
After entering GNDEC firstly I visited the gurudwara sahib where the shabd kirtan started from 9:30 am to 10:30 am,
after shabd kirtan all the students move to hostel no. 2 where the refreshments were ready on the desks. Then after a while all the students moved to auditorium where we were offered with welcome kits.
After that all the students settled down in auditorium then at first we were addressed by Dr. Harpreet kaur Grewal (Head of department of applied sciences).She welcomed the students to the institution and enlightened all of us with her brilliant speech.She concluded the speech on a positive note.Then the second speech was given by our principal sir Dr.Sehijpal Singh who congratulated all the students on securing admission in one of the finest college in north India.He concluded his speech by giving information about college academics, research culture and industry collaborations.Then the third speech was given by sardar Maheshinder Singh Grewal(Trustee of Nankana sahib education trust and former cabinet minister).He addressed us with very inspiring words and also he shared the insightsinto the vision behind the establishment of GNDEC and urges students to uphold the values of this college and work for the betterment of society,by this he concluded his speech.After the formal session,the students proceded to their respective departments and volunteers gave them a tour of their respective departments.In the end,the faculty of the department was introduced to us.
### Day 2
The second started with two proficiency tests i.e english and maths.The time given for each test was 50 minutes.After the proficiency tests,we had a expert lecture of Dr.Arashdeep singh on "Food:A pivotal role in human overall wellness" in the auditorium.He started his speech by explaining the importance of proper diet in a human's life.He also explained the various types of diet such as vegetarian diet, non-vegetarian diet and vegan diet.He explained the three diets in very simple manner.He concluded his speech by congratulating all of us for securing admission in this college.The speech was further followed by a session arranged by causmic club to spread awareness about their club.The session was basically with full information of the causmic club and explaining the doubts that how to join the club and also about the recruitment procedure of club.In the end,we were congratulated by club members on securing admission in the college and this was the end of day 2.

### Day 3
Lecture 1 – Dr. Jaswinder Singh

Dr. Jaswinder’s lecture was honestly pretty fun. The whole auditorium seemed to enjoy it and we got to learn quite a few things. He talked about his thoughts on God and science, and how somehow they connect in unexpected ways. Also, the math tricks he showed were mind-blowing. It wasn’t just the science or nature stuff—he had some wise life tips too. But the thing that really stood out was his crazy energy, like he could go on for hours without slowing down. He also cracked some jokes here and there which kept us awake. Overall, really good session, I walked out feeling smarter.

Lecture 2 – Dr. Priya Darshni

This one was totally different from the first, but in a good way. She focused on human values—things like goals, purpose, and basically what we’re doing with our lives. She explained it step-by-step, which made it easy to follow. At first she seemed a bit quiet and slow-paced, but after a while, it picked up and ended with something meaningful. It actually made me think about my own values. Can’t lie, I’m looking forward to more of her lectures.

### Day 4

Day 4 was another “learn something new” kind of day. I attended two sessions—felt like the start of a fresh journey (even though it’s just an induction). The programme itself was chill as usual.

Dr. Priya Darshni’s Lecture (Again)

This one topped her previous session. She started by quickly recapping last time, then went deeper into new ideas. I liked a lot of what she said—especially about life and purpose—and I’m actually thinking about doing the exercises she gave so I can try applying it for real.

Cosmic Club & Other Stuff

We got introduced to one of GNE’s main clubs—the “Cosmic Club.” The members explained what they do, how it helps build teamwork, and the skills you can pick up if you join. It sounded pretty cool. After that, there were a couple of random but fun things: one sir explained how to choose the right laptop (helpful for anyone planning to get one), and then one student performed a song on guitar. I love how GNE always mixes learning with fun stuff—it keeps things interesting.

## Induction day - 5 report
One day 5, there were no induction programme activities, I believe this day was focused on introducing students to lectures, studies and teachers. Nevertheless, I had a great experience and one more time like always learned about amazing feats of GNE, we got introduced to other great teachers and subjects. We were immediately introduced to our new courses and other important details, most of the teachers instead of burdening us got friendly with us and prioritised introduction conversations and important tips as for college, to make us comfortable with the subject as soon as possible. The day ended with some lectures like I've talked about and some other activities and it was as always a fabulous day for us to learn

## Induction day - 6 report
The day started as normal but as the induction programme started, I was already feeling like new things to learn were there.

Lecture by prof. Lakhvir singh
Professor Lakhvir singh introduced us to CML where we can learn different things, and he tells about different things like joining CML and it was great, CML is obviously an opportunity to learn new things, to learn things like leadership, teamwork, management and even other significant skills. It is always great of GNE to tell us these different things and I always like it, at start it feels just out of blue and completely random but then it starts to make sense and why it's important, I'll definitely consider joining CML for sure.

## Induction day - 7 report
Starting introduction to different GNE facilities by Dr. Parminder singh
Another great experience learning about GNE, as I would definitely require this valueable knowledge and I'm greatful for it.

Lecture by Dr. Amit Kamra
Another fabulous lecture given by and a fabulous introduction to one of the new clubs of DMC, though it was not much to those who don't want to join, but I'll definately consider it so I listened clearly and I was thrilled by the club like I've always been. DMC is basically Digital Marketing Club which also manages the social media of GNE and I think it is great of GNE for introducing this. Many students who want to aspire to be a successful person will definitely require DMC's skills. Although at the time, the club is small but I'm sure of it that it'll grow eventually.

The last lecture on conduct of examination by Dr. Randhir Singh
The last lecture was very informative. Dr. Randhir Singh not only explained the conduct of examinations in detail, including the rules, procedures, and guidelines to be followed, but also guided us through the official college website. He showed us how to access important sections such as notices, results, and academic resources. In addition, he provided information about mid-semester tests, assignments, and their submission processes, along with the evaluation criteria. The session was quite helpful in understanding the academic requirements and how to stay updated throughout the semester.
