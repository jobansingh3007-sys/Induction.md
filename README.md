### Day 1
My first day at GNDEC started with all CSE and IT students.
After entering GNDEC firstly I visited the gurudwara sahib where the shabd kirtan started from 9:30 am to 10:30 am,
after shabd kirtan all the students move to hostel no. 2 where the refreshments were ready on the desks. Then after a while all the students moved to auditorium where we were offered with welcome kits.
After that all the students settled down in auditorium then at first we were addressed by Dr. Harpreet kaur Grewal (Head of department of applied sciences).She welcomed the students to the institution and enlightened all of us with her brilliant speech.She concluded the speech on a positive note.Then the second speech was given by our principal sir Dr.Sehijpal Singh who congratulated all the students on securing admission in one of the finest college in north India.He concluded his speech by giving information about college academics, research culture and industry collaborations.Then the third speech was given by sardar Maheshinder Singh Grewal(Trustee of Nankana sahib education trust and former cabinet minister).He addressed us with very inspiring words and also he shared the insightsinto the vision behind the establishment of GNDEC and urges students to uphold the values of this college and work for the betterment of society,by this he concluded his speech.After the formal session,the students proceded to their respective departments and volunteers gave them a tour of their respective departments.In the end,the faculty of the department was introduced to us.
#### Day 2
The second started with two proficiency tests i.e english and maths.The time given for each test was 50 minutes.After the proficiency tests,we had a expert lecture of Dr.Arashdeep singh on "Food:A pivotal role in human overall wellness" in the auditorium.He started his speech by explaining the importance of proper diet in a human's life.He also explained the various types of diet such as vegetarian diet, non-vegetarian diet and vegan diet.He explained the three diets in very simple manner.He concluded his speech by congratulating all of us for securing admission in this college.The speech was further followed by a session arranged by causmic club to spread awareness about their club.The session was basically with full information of the causmic club and explaining the doubts that how to join the club and also about the recruitment procedure of club.In the end,we were congratulated by club members on securing admission in the college and this was the end of day 2.

##### Day 3
Lecture 1 – Dr. Jaswinder Singh

Dr. Jaswinder’s lecture was honestly pretty fun. The whole auditorium seemed to enjoy it and we got to learn quite a few things. He talked about his thoughts on God and science, and how somehow they connect in unexpected ways. Also, the math tricks he showed were mind-blowing. It wasn’t just the science or nature stuff—he had some wise life tips too. But the thing that really stood out was his crazy energy, like he could go on for hours without slowing down. He also cracked some jokes here and there which kept us awake. Overall, really good session, I walked out feeling smarter.

Lecture 2 – Dr. Priya Darshni

This one was totally different from the first, but in a good way. She focused on human values—things like goals, purpose, and basically what we’re doing with our lives. She explained it step-by-step, which made it easy to follow. At first she seemed a bit quiet and slow-paced, but after a while, it picked up and ended with something meaningful. It actually made me think about my own values. Can’t lie, I’m looking forward to more of her lectures.

Induction Report – Day 4

Day 4 was another “learn something new” kind of day. I attended two sessions—felt like the start of a fresh journey (even though it’s just an induction). The programme itself was chill as usual.

Dr. Priya Darshni’s Lecture (Again)

This one topped her previous session. She started by quickly recapping last time, then went deeper into new ideas. I liked a lot of what she said—especially about life and purpose—and I’m actually thinking about doing the exercises she gave so I can try applying it for real.

Cosmic Club & Other Stuff

We got introduced to one of GNE’s main clubs—the “Cosmic Club.” The members explained what they do, how it helps build teamwork, and the skills you can pick up if you join. It sounded pretty cool. After that, there were a couple of random but fun things: one sir explained how to choose the right laptop (helpful for anyone planning to get one), and then one student performed a song on guitar. I love how GNE always mixes learning with fun stuff—it keeps things interesting.
